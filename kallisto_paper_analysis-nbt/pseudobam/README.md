Here, we look at the performance of pseudobam versus Bowtie 2.
The final output is in the files:

- `results/simulation_comparison_1-NA12716_7_30000000_1_simulation_pseudobam.txt` for the simulation results
- `results/real_comparison_NA12716_7_rsem-NA12716_7_real_data_pseudobam.txt` for results on Geuvadis sample `NA12716_7`
